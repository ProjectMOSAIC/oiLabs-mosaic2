# oiLabs-mosaic2
Source files for OpenIntro Statistics labs using mosaic modeling approach and ggformula

Builds upon the prior work of https://github.com/beanumber/oiLabs-mosaic (last updated November 29, 2016).

The mosaic package is designed to facilitate the use of R in statistics and calculus instruction by providing a number of functions that (a) make many common tasks fit into a common template, and (b) simplify some tasks that would otherwise be too complicated for beginners.  See https://github.com/ProjectMOSAIC/mosaic for more information.

The oilabs package contains the data sets, custom functions, documentation, and templates for the OpenIntro Labs(see http://openintrostat.github.io/oilabs and https://github.com/OpenIntroStat/oilabs).
