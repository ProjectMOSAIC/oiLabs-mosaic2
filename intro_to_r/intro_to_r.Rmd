The goal of this lab is to introduce you to R and RStudio, which you'll be using
throughout the course both to learn the statistical concepts discussed in the 
textbook and also to analyze real data and come to informed conclusions.  To 
straighten out which is which: R is the name of the programming language itself 
and RStudio is a convenient interface.

As the labs progress, you are encouraged to explore beyond what the labs dictate;
a willingness to experiment will make you a much better programmer.  Before we 
get to that stage, however, you need to build some basic fluency in R.  Today we
begin with the fundamental building blocks of R and RStudio: the interface, 
reading in data, and basic commands.

![rinterface](more/rInterface2014.png)

The panel in the upper right contains your *workspace* as well as a history of 
the commands that you've previously entered.  Any plots that you generate will 
show up in the panel in the lower right corner.

The panel on the left is where the action happens.  It's called the *console*. 
Everytime you launch RStudio, it will have the same text at the top of the 
console telling you the version of R that you're running.  Below that information
is the *prompt*.  As its name suggests, this prompt is really a request, a 
request for a command.  Initially, interacting with R is all about typing commands
and interpreting the output. These commands and their syntax have evolved over
decades (literally) and now provide what many users feel is a fairly natural way
to access data and organize, describe, and invoke statistical computations.

To get you started, enter all commands at the R prompt (i.e. right after
`>` on the console); you can either type them in manually or copy and paste them
from this document.

R has a number of additional packages that help you perform specific tasks. 
In order to use these packages, they must be installed (you only have to do this 
once) and loaded (you have to do this every time you start an R session). 

```{r opts, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)
opts_chunk$set(eval = FALSE)
```

If you have not installed the packages already, run the commands below. It may take a few minutes; you'll know when the packages have finished installing when you see the R prompt return in your console.
```{r load-devtools-oilabs, message = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c("dplyr", "ggplot2", "devtools"))
devtools::install_github("andrewpbray/oilabs")
```

Then, we can load the packages
```{r load-packages, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE}
#library(oilabs)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```


## The Data: Dr. Arbuthnot's Baptism Records

The data for this lab are Arbuthnot baptism counts for boys and girls, which we load into R as follows:

```{r load-abrbuthnot-data, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE}
data(arbuthnot)
```

You should see that the environment area in the upper righthand corner of the RStudio window now lists a 
data set called `arbuthnot` that has 82 observations on 3 variables. As you 
interact with R, you will create a series of objects. Sometimes you load them as
we have done here, and sometimes you create them yourself as the byproduct of a 
computation or some analysis you have performed. Note that because you are 
working on the RStudio server, this data comes preloaded. If you would like to
run RStudio locally on your own computer please ask me how you can access this 
data (it's super quick to do).

The Arbuthnot data set refers to Dr. John Arbuthnot, an 18<sup>th</sup> century 
physician, writer, and mathematician.  He was interested in the ratio of newborn
boys to newborn girls, so he gathered the baptism records for children born in
London for every year from 1629 to 1710.  We can take a look at the data by 
typing its name into the console.

```{r view-data}
arbuthnot
```

What you should see are four columns of numbers, each row representing a 
different year: the first entry in each row is simply the row number (an index 
we can use to access the data from individual years if we want), the second is 
the year, and the third and fourth are the numbers of boys and girls baptized 
that year, respectively. Use the scrollbar on the right side of the console 
window to examine the complete data set.

Note that the row numbers in the first column are not part of Arbuthnot's data. 
R adds them as part of its printout to help you make visual comparisons. You can
think of them as the index that you see on the left side of a spreadsheet. In 
fact, the comparison to a spreadsheet will generally be helpful. R has stored 
Arbuthnot's data in a kind of spreadsheet or table called a *data frame*.

You can confirm this by typing: 

```{r class-data, eval = TRUE}
class(arbuthnot)
```

Now that you know that you have tabular data at hand, 
a useful next step is to get a big picture of the contents of the data. 

Find the dimensions of this data frame by typing:

```{r dim-data, eval = TRUE}
dim(arbuthnot)
```

This command should output `[1] 82 3`, indicating that there are 82 rows and 3 
columns, just as it says next to the object in your environment. 
This is a reasonably-sized data, so we did not run into any problems 
typing its name into the console earlier to view the entire set.
Checking to make sure that the dimensions of your data are not too large, 
you can avoid trying to project all of the values. 

Find the names of these columns (or variables) by typing:

```{r names-data, eval = TRUE}
names(arbuthnot)
```

You should see that the data frame contains the columns `year`,  `boys`, and 
`girls`. At this point, you might notice that many of the commands in R look a 
lot like functions from math class; that is, invoking R commands means supplying
a function with some number of arguments. The `dim` and `names` commands, for 
example, each took a single argument, the name of a data frame. 

A concise way to get the above information is to type:
```{r structure-data, eval = TRUE}
str(arbuthnot)
```

The `str` command outputs the structure of the data, which includes the dataset's class, dimensions,
and variable names.

One advantage of RStudio is that it comes with a built-in data viewer. Click on
the name `arbuthnot` in the *Environment* pane (upper right window) that lists 
the objects in your environment. This will bring up an alternative display of the 
data set in the *Data Viewer* (upper left window). You can close the data viewer
by clicking on the *x* in the upper lefthand corner.

## Some Exploration

Let's start to examine the data a little more closely. We can access the data in
a single column of a data frame separately using a command like

```{r view-boys}
arbuthnot %>% 
  select(boys)
```

This command will only show the number of boys baptized each year.

Notice that the special operator `%>%` is being used here. The `%>%` is called the 
'pipe' operator. Many languages have pipe operators, and they allow functions to 
pass things along a chain of commands. In R, we often read `%>%` as the English 
word 'then.' So, we could read this code as saying, 'take the `arbuthnot` data, 
then select the `boys` variable.' 

1.  What command would you use to extract just the counts of girls baptized? Try
    it!

There is an additional package for R called `mosaic` that streamlines all of the commands that you will need in this course. This package is specifically designed by a team of NSF-funded educators to make R more accessible to introductory statistics students like you. The [`mosaic` package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mosaic/index.html) doesn't provide new functionality so much as it makes existing functionality more logical, consistent, all the while emphasizing importants concepts in statistics. 

To use the package, you will first need to install it.

```{r install-mosaic, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("mosaic")
```

Note that you will only have to do this *once*. However, once the package is installed, you will have to load it into the current workspace before it can be used. 

```{r require-mosaic, message=FALSE}
library(mosaic)
```

Note that you will have to do this *every* time you start a new R session. 

R has some powerful functions for making graphics. 

The centerpiece of the `mosaic` syntax is the use of the *modeling language*. This involves the use of a tilde (~), which can be read as "is a function of".

We can create a simple plot of the number of girls baptized per year with the command

```{r plot-girls-vs-year, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE}
xyplot(girls ~ year, data=arbuthnot)
```

By default, R creates a scatterplot with each x,y pair indicated by an open circle. The plot itself should appear under the *Plots* tab of the lower right panel of RStudio. Notice that the command above is a function called `xyplot` that takes two arguments separated by a comma.  The first argument to the `xyplot` function is a formula of the form `y ~ x` that specifies which variable should go on the vertical (`y`) axis and which should go on the horizontal (`x`) axis. The `data` argument tell R where to find the `girls` and `year` variables -- in this case, they are inside the data frame called `arbuthnot`. You will find that you can perform most of the operations that you will see in this class using this simple template. [Please see the [Less Volume, More Creativity](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mosaic/vignettes/LessVolume-MoreCreativity.html) vignette for more information about this.]

If we wish to plot `l`ines instead of `p`oints, we can add the `type` argument. Note below that the `type` argument is the letter `l` and not the number `1`.  

```{r plot-girls-vs-year-line, eval=FALSE}
xyplot(girls ~ year, data=arbuthnot, type = "l")
```

You might wonder how you are supposed to know that it was possible to add that 
third argument.  Thankfully, R documents all of its functions extensively. To 
read what a function does and learn the arguments that are available to you, 
just type in a question mark followed by the name of the function that you're 
interested in. Try the following.

```{r plot-help, eval=FALSE, tidy = FALSE}
?xyplot
```

Notice that the help file replaces the plot in the lower right panel. You can 
toggle between plots and help files using the tabs at the top of that panel.

2.  Is there an apparent trend in the number of girls baptized over the years? 
How would you describe it?

Now, suppose we want to plot the total number of baptisms.  To compute this, we 
could use the fact that R is really just a big calculator. We can type in 
mathematical expressions like

```{r calc-total-bapt-numbers}
5218 + 4683
```

to see the total number of baptisms in 1629. We could repeat this once for each 
year, but there is a faster way. If we add the variable for baptisms for boys to 
that of girls, R will compute all sums simultaneously.

```{r calc-total-bapt-vars}
arbuthnot %>%
  mutate(total = boys + girls)
```

Again, we can read this chunk of code by saying, 'take the `arbuthnot` data, and 
then mutate it so there is an additional column called total, which is comprised 
of the columns `boys` and `girls` added together.'

You'll see that there is now a new column called `total` that has been tacked on
to the data frame. What `total` contains is a list of 82 numbers, each one 
representing the sum we’re after. Take a look at a few of them and verify that 
they are right.

While this output looks like our original dataset with an additional column 
added, it was just temporarily shown to us in the console. In order to use that 
column again, we have to save it. 

```{r calc-total-bapt-vars-save}
arbuthnot <- 
  arbuthnot %>%
  mutate(total = boys + girls)
```

The special symbol `<-` performs an *assignment*, taking the output of a line of 
code or series of piped commands, and saving it into an object in your environment. 
In this case, you already have an object called `arbuthnot`, so this command updates
that data set with the new mutated column.

We can make a plot of the total number of baptisms per year with the command

```{r plot-total-vs-year}
xyplot(boys + girls ~ year, data=arbuthnot, type = "l")
```

Similarly to how we computed the total number of births, we can compute the ratio 
of the number of boys to the number of girls baptized in 1629 with

```{r calc-prop-boys-to-girls-numbers}
5218 / 4683
```

or we can act on the complete columns with the expression

```{r calc-prop-boys-to-girls-vars}
arbuthnot %>%
  mutate(ratio = boys / girls)
```

We can also compute the proportion of newborns that are boys

```{r calc-prop-boys-numbers}
5218 / (5218 + 4683)
```

or this may also be computed for all years simultaneously:

```{r calc-prop-boys-vars}
arbuthnot %>%
  mutate(prop = boys / (boys + girls))
```

Note that with R as with your calculator, you need to be conscious of the order 
of operations.  Here, we want to divide the number of boys by the total number 
of newborns, so we have to use parentheses.  Without them, R will first do the 
division, then the addition, giving you something that is not a proportion.

3.  Now, *mutate* the data frame once more to include a new column for the 
proportion of newborns that are boys, then generate a plot of that proportion 
over time. What do you see? Tip: If you use the up and down arrow keys, you can 
scroll through your previous commands, your so-called command history. You can 
also access it by clicking on the history tab in the upper right panel.  This 
will save you a lot of typing in the future.

Finally, in addition to simple mathematical operators like subtraction and 
division, you can ask R to make comparisons like greater than, `>`, greater than or equal, `>=`, less than,
`<`, less than or equal, `<=`, and equality, `==`. For example, we can ask if boys outnumber girls in each 
year with the expression

```{r boys-more-than-girls}
arbuthnot %>%
  mutate(boys > girls)
```

This command returns a dataframe with an additional variable tacked on. 
The values of this variable are either `TRUE` if that year had more boys
than girls, or `FALSE` if that year did not (the answer may surprise you). This 
output shows a different kind of data than we have considered so far. All other
columns in the `arbuthnot` data frame have values are numerical (the year, the 
number of boys and girls). Here, we've asked R to create *logical* data, data 
where the values are either `TRUE` or `FALSE`. In general, data analysis will 
involve many different kinds of data types, and one reason for using R is that 
it is able to represent and compute with many of them.

This seems like a fair bit for your first lab, so let's stop here. To exit 
RStudio you can click on the log out link at the upper right corner of the screen.
Go ahead and log out and then sign back in. You'll find your R session is just
as you left it.

## On Your Own

In the previous few pages, you recreated some of the displays and preliminary 
analysis of Arbuthnot's baptism data. Your assignment involves repeating these 
steps, but for present day birth records in the United States.  Load up the 
present day data with the following command.

```{r load-present-data, eval=FALSE}
data(present)
```

The data are stored in a data frame called `present`.

-   What years are included in this data set? What are the dimensions of the 
    data frame and what are the variable or column names?

-   How do the counts of boys and girls in the present day birth records compare to Arbuthnot's? Are they on a similar scale?

-   Make a plot that displays the boy-to-girl ratio for every year in the data 
    set. What do you see? Does Arbuthnot's observation about boys being born in
    greater proportion than girls hold up in the U.S.? Include the plot in your 
    response.

-   In what year did we see the most total number of births in the U.S.?

These data come from a report by the Centers for Disease Control 
[http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr53/nvsr53_20.pdf](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr53/nvsr53_20.pdf).

That was a short introduction to R and RStudio, but we will provide you with more
functions and a more complete sense of the language as the course progresses.
